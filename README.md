## Project Description
CineSeek is a modern movie discovery application built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The application allows users to browse movies from the MoviesDatabase API, view movie details, and search for films by year or genre. The project focuses on creating a responsive, well-structured web application with proper API integration and TypeScript typing

## API Integration
The application uses the MoviesDatabase API with the following key endpoints: - /titles - Main endpoint for fetching movie data - Supports filtering by year and genre - Implements pagination for browsing through results

## Learning Objectives
To use an API right; to read and understand the API documentation. This will give you a clear outline of what is needed to successfully make an API request, while further manipulating the response object. Especially, in TypeScript, knowing the structure of the request and response object allows you to design types or interfaces.
